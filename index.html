                    Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations
                    and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous
                    physical exercise, and sufficient rest.

                <p>
                    Fast-Paced And Difficult To Master, Muay Thai Is One Of Thailand's Proudest Traditions. It is referred to as the "Art of
                    Eight Limbs" or the "Science of Eight Limbs", because it makes use of punches, kicks, elbows and knee
                    strikes, thus using eight "points of contact", as opposed to "two points" (fists) in boxing and "four
                    points" (hands and feet) used in other more regulated combat sports, such as kickboxing and savate.[5]
                    A practitioner of muay Thai is known as a nak muay. Western practitioners are sometimes called Nak Muay
                    Farang, meaning "foreign boxer."

                    Sparring is a form of training common to many combat sports. Although the precise form varies, it is essentially relatively
                    'free-form' fighting, with enough rules, customs, or agreements to make injuries unlikely.

                <p>
                    In hand-to-hand combat, grappling is a close fighting technique used to gain a physical advantage such as improving relative
                    position, or causing injury to the opponent. Grappling covers techniques used in many disciplines, styles
                    and martial arts that are practiced both as combat sports and for self-defense.
